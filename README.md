# GREEN_BEAN

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game! While hardly a unique early project for an aspiring developer,
I found it really interesting, gratifying, frustrating, and fun. 

This site utilizes a mix of CSS, HTML, and vanilla Javascript to establish a grid where
through alternating turns players mark an x or o by clicking. If one player reaches three
x's or o's, they've won and the game restarts.
